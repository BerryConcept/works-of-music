# Welcome to **My Works of Music**

> This repository is designed to store everything related to my own interest of music production. **No commercial intentions for now**

## A Brief Introduction

This repository is currently focused on creating compilations of my own original works regarding VOCALOID songs production.
I am currently working on my own as an extracurricular composer, lyricist, arranger, and vocaloid tuner. I always come up with my own melody and rhythm and try my best to present my own unique understanding of music production to everyone.  
I am an active college student majoring in fields like Computer Science and Cognitive Science, so music production is more of my pure interest rather than my expertise. Therefore, my works in this repository could appear as lacking some extents of professionality, and any aspects of help and suggestions for any potential improvements will be greatly appreciated!
I used to be a YAMAHA eletric organ player and piano player when I was very young, so I am more confident of handling music with clean, concise and refreshing styles. Though I am always willing to try out other different styles as well, since as an amateur I don't want to confine myself to any particular single style or genre.

## My Current Plan

My major focus for now is to continue producing more songs based on VOCALOID voicebank tuned singing, and my first compilation is already planned and established. I will focus on using VOCALOID China female voicebank Yuezheng Ling and produce six to seven songs for this compilation. This is still a tentative plan though and is always subject to change, but I will try my best to stick with it and keep up my progress.

## Copyright and License

All of my own original works up to now are noncommercial. I don't have any intentions or plans to make a living from my pure enthusiasm. And I am kindly request everyone to respect my works and do not republish my efforts in any other places without my formal permissions. Thanks for understanding!
