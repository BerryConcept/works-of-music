## A Brief Introduction

This repository is currently focused on creating compilations of my own original works regarding all music pieces and song productions.

I am currently working on my own as an extracurricular composer, lyricist, arranger, and Vocaloid tuner. I always come up with my own melody and rhythm and try my best to present my own unique interpretation of the music to everyone.

I am an active college student majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive Science, so music production is more of my pure interest than expertise. Therefore, my works in this repository could be evidently lacking in professional experiences. As a result, any aspects of help and suggestions for any potential improvements will be deeply appreciated!

I was trained to become an electric organ and piano player when I was very young, so I am more confident in handling music with clean, concise, and refreshing styles. However, I am always willing to try out other different styles as well, since as an amateur I don't want to confine myself to any particular single style or genre. 

Though my current works primarily focus on producing instrumental music pieces and Vocaloid-based songs, I do plan to explore more fields in the near future. Currently, I don't plan to do song productions with human singers though due to the reason that I have very limited experience and skills in sound effects and voice mixing.

## My Passion

My interest in music production emerged a long time ago, probably ever since I kind of got tired of playing others' melodies over and over again on my electric organ. At that time, I always dreamed of coming up with my own songs, and I love to sing songs. I could remember myself "playing" and enjoying my own rhythm pieces just using my mouth, literally my teeth, and my tongue not as a singer but as instruments, like what a beatboxer would do. I was not satisfied with that and kept looking for opportunities to sing more songs. However, during my adolescence, my voice has changed. I felt really devastated that I could not reach some pitch height that I used to be pretty good at. Combining with more and more busy life in schools, I kind of put my dream aside. Things have got changed in the October of 2017, out of complete coincidence, I came across a beautiful song presented with a simple but emotional tone. That instantly grabbed my attention from a longingly unfulfilled dream. Later I learned the song was a piece of ordinary archaistic pop music produced by a group of singers but republished by a Vocaloid tuner with a Vocaloid voicebank, and that was exactly where I began my exploration of Vocaloid and its related song productions. It looked like I finally found a replacement for my own voice and this could help me propel my dream off the ground. I dug deep into this field and began to integrate this technique in my pursuit of music productions.

## My Current Work

My main focus for now is to continue honing my skills in music production by creating more sample pieces and producing more songs based on Vocaloid voicebank tuned singing. My first and second compilations were planned as follows. For the first compilation, I will continue focusing on using Vocaloid China female voicebank Yuezheng Ling (乐正绫) and produce around six to seven songs in total. The second compilation was dedicated to assisting my undergraduate research work in Eco Resilience Games Research Group at GSAS Program in RPI, where I was so proud to become a game programmer, a music composer, and a sound engineer for the development of the AR game project, Algae Bloom Dynamics. All works listed in the second compilation were the original soundtracks that got implemented into this game. This is still a tentative plan of my compilations and is still subject to change without notice, but I will try my best to stick with it and keep things updated.
