## A Brief Introduction

This repository is currently focused on creating compilations of my own original works regarding VOCALOID songs production.

I am currently working on my own as an extracurricular composer, lyricist, arranger, and vocaloid tuner. I always come up with my own melody and rhythm and try my best to present my own unique understanding of music production to everyone.

I am an active college student majoring in fields like Computer Science and Cognitive Science, so music production is more of my pure interest rather than my expertise. Therefore, my works in this repository could appear as lacking some extents of professionality, and any aspects of help and suggestions for any potential improvements will be greatly appreciated!

I used to be a Yamaha eletric organ player and piano player when I was very young, so I am more confident of handling music with clean, concise and refreshing styles. Though I am always willing to try out other different styles as well, since as an amateur I don't want to confine myself to any particular single style or genre. 

Though my works primarily focus on VOCALOID songs, I do work on pure instrumental music, background music as well. Currently, I don't plan to do song productions with human singers though since I only have very limited ability to voice mixing.

## My Enthusiasm

My interest of music production emerged long time ago, probably ever since I kind of got tired of playing others melodies over and over again on my electric organ. At that time, I always dreamed of coming up with my own songs, and I love sing songs. I could remember myself "playing" and enjoying my own rhythm pieces just using my mouth, literally my teeth and my tongue not only as singer but as instruments, like what a modern beat boxer would do. I was not satisfied with that and kept looking for opportunities to sing more songs. However, during my adolescence my voice has changed. I felt really devastated that I could not reach some pitch height that I used to be pretty good at. Combining with more and more busy life in schools, I kind of laid of dream aside. Things have got changed in the October of 2017, out of complete coincidence, I came across a beautiful song presented with a cute but emotional tone. That instantly grabbed my attention from a longingly unfulfilled dream. Later I learned the song was a noraml archaistic pop music produced by a group of singers but republished by an VOCALOID tuner with a VOCALOID Chinese voicebank, and that was exactly where I began my exploration of VOCALOID and its realted song productions. It looked like I finally found a replacement of my own voice and this could really help me propel my dream off the ground. I digged deep into this field and began to integrate this technique in my pursuit of music productions.

## My Current Plan

My major focus for now is to continue producing more songs based on VOCALOID voicebank tuned singing, and my first compilation is already planned and established. I will focus on using VOCALOID China female Chinese voicebank Yuezheng Ling (乐正绫) and produce six to seven songs for this compilation. This is still a tentative plan though and is always subject to change, but I will try my best to stick with it and keep up my progress.
